This is a new paragraph. I wonder    if I have too     many spaces.
What about new paragraph.
But the next one...

  Is really new.

1.  Item one.
1. Item TWO.

- [x] foo
    - [ ] bar
    - [X] baz
- [ ] bim

```go
f, err := os.Open(something)
    if err != nil {
    // handle..
}
defer f.Close() // What if an error occurs here?

// Write something to file... etc.
```

Paragraphs will be also concatenated for clean view.
However, it might be not easy to edit it via editors, so you can specify text line width to be ensured. It also makes sure words are together,so it will ensure wanted line length as you wish.

Subtitle {other=attribute class="subhead bold" id=sub}

How about `this` and other stuff 
like *italic*, _underline italic_, **bold**, **bold    spaces**.

Final paragraph.
