Itemized lists look like:

- this one
- that one
- the other one

Or with stars

* this one
* that one
* the other one

Nothing to note here.

1. Item 1
2. Item 2
   1. Item 2a
      - Item 2aa
   2. Item 2b
3. Item 3

Hmm.

1. Item 1
2. Item 2
   1. Blah.
   2. Blah.
3. Item 3
   - Item 3a
   - Item 3b
